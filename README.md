# Faster-than-Light-Quantum-Teleportation-Algorithm-Protocol

Teleportation of Quantum State is instanteneously i.e. as soon as Alice measures her qubits , Bob's Qubits receive the state , due to Bob having the entangled particles (qubits) that he shares with Alice . But this is limited by requirement of transfer of measured quatum state at Alice side via a Classical Communication Channel which is limited by speed of light . But here we propose a solution to remove the need for classical communications and instantaneous transfer of '0' and '1' states to Bob, as soon as Alice measures her state. Note -> Here we assume that irrespective of what planet , gravity , environment conditions Bob is in the state transfer is instantaeous , irrespective of it.

# Code For Finding the Two UNitary Matrices of Alice for zero and one Bit Communication , Unitary Matrix of Classification of Bob , the Partially Entangled
# State that Bob and Alice Shares , Partial Entanglement between Alice's Output State of here Eight Qubits by using Backpropogation Algorithm to minimize the 
# RMSE loss between the ouptut states i.e. the Bob's States after he applies his unitary of Clasification to classify the input state that Alice Sends , which can 
# be any one of the 256 output states of class 0 or 256 Output states of class 1. Also entanglement Constriants are added on the input state that Alice Shares
# with Bob , and also the top four and the bottom four qubits of the Alice , to further entangle the Alice's state with her part of the entangled qubits that
# she shares with Bob. Here No cloning is not violated as one can always use the same unitary circuit to create a approximate replica , not clone it , but produce it
# again , so same entangled state pairs are shared in 1000's or lakhs for entire communication priorly when ALice and BOb are together.
