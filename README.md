# Faster-than-Light-Quantum-Teleportation-Algorithm-Protocol

Teleportation of Quantum State is instanteneously i.e. as soon as Alice measures her qubits , Bob's Qubits receive the state , due to Bob having the entangled particles (qubits) that he shares with Alice . But this is limited by requirement of transfer of measured quatum state at Alice side via a Classical Communication Channel which is limited by speed of light . But here we propose a solution to remove the need for classical communications and instantaneous transfer of '0' and '1' states to Bob, as soon as Alice measures her state. Note -> Here we assume that irrespective of what planet , gravity , environment conditions Bob is in the state transfer is instantaeous , irrespective of it.

PS- For 3 Qubit Faster than light Quantum Teleportation Protocol implemented the comments are not changed and kept the same as 12 qubit case , but only necessary changes are made , may be i will do it sometime later , for now kindly bear with it , other than that the implementation is valid for 3 qubit case.
